.
 
Dr.
 
Pashos
 
brings
 
significant
 
startup
 
and
 
competition
 
experience,
 
including
 
a
 
successful
 
run
 
at
 
the
 
2016
 
Rice

Competition
,
 
where
 
his

$25,000
 
Women’s

Problem
 
&
 
Customer
 
Pain
 
Job
 
seekers
 
increasingly
 
rely
 
on
 
mobile
 
devices:
 
studies
 
show
 
that
 
as
 
many
 
as
 
67%
 
of
 
job
 
applications
 
were
 
completed
 
on
 
mobile
 
devices
 
in
 
2021
,
1
 
and
 
nearly
 
90%
 
of
 
job
 
seekers
 
use
 
mobile
 
devices
 
in
 
some
 
aspect
 
of
 
their
 
job
 
search
.
2
 
However,
 
many
 
current
 
job
 
boards
 
and
 
career
 
portals
 
are
 
not
 
optimized
 
for
 
true
 
mobile
 
application
 
experiences,
 
leading
 
to
 
lower
 
completion
 
rates
 
and
 
user
 
frustration.
 
 
 
At
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
the
 
hiring
 
market
 
has
 
become
 
significantly
 
more
 
competitive.
 
The
 
number
 
of
 
applications
 
submitted
 
per
 
job
 
increased
 
by
 
nearly
 
threefold
 
between
 
January
 
2021
 
and
 
April
 
2023
,
 
while
 
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
open
 
job
 
postings
 
declined
 
during
 
the
 
same
 
period
 
(Figure
 
1).

This
 
applicant
 
saturation
 
is
 
further
 
intensified
 
by
 
a
 
steady
 
influx
 
of
 
new
 
graduates.
 
In
 
Spring
 
2025
 
alone,
 
over
 
2.1
 
million
 
bachelor’s
 
degrees
 
were
 
conferred
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
,
4
 
dramatically
 
expanding
 
the
 
entry-level
 
talent
 
pool.
 
To
 
manage
 
growing
 
applicant
 
volume,
 
many
 
employers
 
have
 
turned
 
to
 
AI-based
 
resume
 
screening
 
tools.
 
By
 
2025,
 
48%
 
of
 
hiring
 
managers
 
reported
 
using
 
AI
 
to
 
screen
 
resumes
,
 
with
 
projections
 
indicating
 
adoption
 
rising
 
to
 
83%
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year
.
 
However,
 
67%
 
of
 
these
 
employers
 
acknowledge
 
concerns
 
that
 
AI-driven
 
screening
 
may
 
introduce
 
bias
 
or
 
incorrectly
 
filter
 
qualified
 
candidates
.
5
 
 
 
Together,
 
these
 
trends
 
reveal
 
a
 
clear
 
gap
 
in
 
today’s
 
hiring
 
ecosystem—one
 
that
 
demands
 
a
 
mobile-first
 
hiring
 
platform
 
designed
 
to
 
reduce
 
friction
 
for
 
applicants
 
while
 
enabling
 
more
 
intentional,
 
role-based
 
candidate
 
screening
 
for
 
employers.
 
 
Customer
 
Analysis
 
 
HireOn
 
is
 
a
 
business-to-business
 
(B2B),
 
multi-sided
 
SaaS
 
platform
 
serving
 
employers
 
and
 
job
 
seekers,
 
with
 
employers
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
revenue-generating
 
customers.
 
Employers—particularly
 
small
 
to
 
mid-sized
 
businesses,
 
campus
 
recruiters,
 
and
 
early-career
 
hiring
 
teams—face
 
overwhelming
 
applicant
 
volume,
 
inefficient
 
resume
 
screening,
 
and
 
applicant
 
tracking
 
systems
 
that
 
rely
 
heavily
 
on
 
AI-assisted
 
keyword
 

filtering.
 
These
 
systems
 
often
 
fail
 
to
 
surface
 
qualified
 
candidates
 
and
 
require
 
significant
 
recruiter
 
time
 
to
 
manage.
 
Job
 
seekers,
 
especially
 
students
 
and
 
recent
 
graduates,
 
encounter
 
a
 
fragmented
 
and
 
desktop-centric
 
hiring
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
is
 
poorly
 
optimized
 
for
 
mobile
 
use.
 
Lengthy
 
applications,
 
repetitive
 
data
 
entry,
 
and
 
opaque
 
AI
 
screening
 
processes
 
contribute
 
to
 
low
 
completion
 
rates
 
and
 
user
 
frustration.
 
HireOn
 
addresses
 
both
 
sides
 
of
 
the
 
market
 
by
 
reducing
 
application
 
friction
 
for
 
candidates
 
while
 
enabling
 
employers
 
to
 
screen
 
applicants
 
intentionally
 
through
 
predefined,
 
qualification-based
 
roles
 
rather
 
than
 
keyword
 
density.
 
Early
 
validation
 
includes
 
strong
 
interest
 
from
 
students
 
at
 
Mississippi
 
State
 
University
,
 
the
 
E-Center
 
for
 
Entrepreneurship
,
 
and
 
campus
 
recruiting
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
have
 
identified
 
mobile
 
usability
 
limitations
 
and
 
applicant
 
overload
 
as
 
persistent
 
hiring
 
challenges.
 
Market
 
Analysis
 
The
 
recruitment
 
and
 
talent
 
acquisition
 
software
 
market
 
is
 
growing
 
rapidly
 
as
 
employers
 
adopt
 
digital
 
tools
 
to
 
improve
 
hiring
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
recruitment
 
software
 
segment
 
is
 
projected
 
to
 
expand
 
from
 
approximately
 
$3.3
 
billion
 
in
 
2025
 
to
 
over
 
$6
 
billion
 
by
 
2032
,
 
while
 
broader
 
talent
 
acquisition
 
platforms
 
are
 
valued
 
at
 
over
 
$10
 
billion
 
today
 
with
 
significant
 
forecast
 
growth
.

HireOn
 
initially
 
targets
 
the
 
U.S.
 
early-career
 
and
 
entry-level
 
hiring
 
segment,
 
including
 
campus
 
recruiting
 
teams,
 
internships,
 
and
 
junior
 
professional
 
roles
 
-
 
an
 
underserved
 
segment
 
characterized
 
by
 
high
 
applicant
 
volume,
 
limited
 
recruiter
 
bandwidth,
 
and
 
inefficient
 
screening
 
processes.
 
 
 
With
 
more
 
than
 
2
 
million
 
bachelor’s
 
degree
 
graduates
 
entering
 
the
 
U.S.
 
each
 
year,
 
4
 
early-career
 
hiring
 
represents
 
a
 
recurring
 
and
 
expanding
 
market.
 
HireOn’s
 
serviceable
 
obtainable
 
market
 
(SOM)
 
focuses
 
on
 
small
 
to
 
mid-sized
 
employers
 
and
 
campus
 
recruiting
 
teams
 
hiring
 
early-career
 
talent,
 
providing
 
a
 
focused
 
entry
 
point
 
with
 
clear
 
expansion
 
opportunities
 
into
 
broader
 
enterprising
 
hiring
 
and
 
specialized
 
workforce
 
verticals.
 
 
 
Product/Technology
 
HireOn
 
is
 
a
 
mobile-first
 
SaaS
 
hiring
 
platform
 
designed
 
to
 
reduce
 
friction
 
in
 
job
 
applications
 
and
 
improve
 
employer
 
screening
 
efficiency.
 
Unlike
 
traditional
 
job
 
boards
 
optimized
 
for
 
desktop
 
workflows,
 
HireOn
 
enables
 
candidates
 
to
 
apply
 
seamlessly
 
from
 
mobile
 
devices
 
through
 
structured,
 
profile-based
 
applications.
 
The
 
platform
 
leverages
 
AI
 
to
 
extract
 
and
 
organize
 
candidate
 
qualifications
 
into
 
role-based
 
profiles
,
 
enabling
 
employers
 
to
 
screen
 
applicants
 
based
 
on
 
predefined
 
qualification
 
roles
 
rather
 
than
 
keyword
 
density
 
alone.
 
Employers
 
can
 
specify
 
both
 
the
 
roles
 
they
 
seek
 
and
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
applicants
 
they
 
wish
 
to
 
screen,
 
reducing
 
applicant
 
overload
 
and
 
improving
 
signal
 
quality.
 
HireOn
 
is
 
currently
 
in
 
early-stage
 
development,
 
with
 
core
 
system
 
architecture,
 
product
 
design,
 
and
 
user
 
validation
 
underway.
 
Initial
 
technical
 
validation
 
is
 
supported
 
through
 
platform
 
prototyping,
 
user
 
interviews,
 
and
 
pilot
 
planning
 
with
 
early
 
stakeholders.
 
While
 
HireOn
 
does
 
not
 
rely
 
on
 
novel
 
hardware
 
or
 
proprietary
 
algorithms,
 
the
 
platform’s
 
defensibility
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
its
 
role-based
 
data
 
structure,
 
mobile-first
 
workflow
 
design,
 
and
 
iterative
 
product
 
development
 
informed
 
by
 
early
 
customer
 
feedback—elements
 
that
 
are
 
difficult
 
to
 
replicate
 
without
 
rebuilding
 
core
 
hiring
 
workflows
 
from
 
the
 
ground
 
up.
 
HireOn
 
does
 
not
 
currently
 
rely
 
on
 
patented
 
technology.
 
The
 
company’s
 
intellectual
 
property
 
strategy
 
centers
 
on
 
proprietary
 
workflow
 
design,
 
structured
 
role-based
 
applicant
 
data
 
models,
 
and
 
platform
 
execution.
 
Evoltas
 
plans
 
to
 
evaluate
 
formal
 
IP
 
protections
 
as
 
the
 
product
 
matures
 
and
 
customer
 
adoption
 
grows.
 
Competitive
 
Differentiation
 
 
HireOn
 
competes
 
with
 
platforms
 
such
 
as
 
LinkedIn,
 
Indeed,
 
and
 
Handshake
 
but
 
differentiates
 
itself
 
through
 
a
 
focused,
 
mobile-first
 
approach.
 
Key
 
differentiators
 
include:
 
●
 
Mobile-First
 
Design:
 
Built
 
specifically
 
for
 
smartphone
 
use
 
rather
 
than
 
adapted
 
from
 
desktop
 
workflows.
 
●
 
Role-Based
 
Screening:
 
Applicants
 
are
 
matched
 
and
 
screened
 
based
 
on
 
structured
 
qualification
 
roles
 
rather
 
than
 
keyword-heavy
 
resumes.
 
●
 
Controlled
 
Applicant
 
Volume:
 
Employers
 
define
 
how
 
many
 
applicants
 
they
 
review,
 
reducing
 
recruiter
 
overload.
 
●
 
Improved
 
Hiring
 
Signal:
 
Reduced
 
false
 
negatives
 
and
 
bias
 
introduced
 
by
 
keyword-based
 
AI
 
filtering.
 
Together,
 
these
 
differentiators
 
translate
 
into
 
clear
 
return
 
on
 
investment
 
for
 
employers.
 
By
 
reducing
 
applicant
 
overload
 
and
 
minimizing
 
time
 
spent
 
screening
 
unqualified
 
candidates,
 
HireOn
 
enables
 
recruiters
 
to
 
recover
 
meaningful
 
labor
 
costs
 
per
 
role.
 
Even
 
modest
 
efficiency
 
gains
 
allow
 
the
 
platform
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
itself
 
at
 
its
 
annual
 
subscription
 
price
 
while
 
improving
 
hiring
 
speed
 
and
 
candidate
 
quality.
